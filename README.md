# Arduino-Interfacing-with-Infrared-Sensor

As per the property of light — light falling on a smooth shiny surface bounces off in a particular direction i.e. reflection — the ray send by IR Transmitter gets reflected from a surface and falls on IR Reciever. Subsequently, the receiver’s resistance drops, and a LOW/0 signal is sent by the OUT pin to the microcontroller.
Similarly, when the light sent isn’t reflected either because there is no surface ahead or the surface ahead absorbs light, the resistance of the receiver rises and a HIGH/1 signal is sent by OUT pin to the microcontroller.![IRArduino](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6374773/208240903-a1a21160-ce12-40e1-84e4-5de830f272a3.png)
